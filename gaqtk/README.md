# gaqtk #

Temporary module name Genome Assembly Quality Toolkit (gaqtk) - a
toolkit for generating interactive quality plots for genomic data.

## Aim ##

Generate some proof-of-concept examples using

1. [mpld3](http://mpld3.github.io/index.html) - a plotting library
   that brings [d3](http://d3js.org/) to
   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). Matplotlib is the *de facto*
   standard for plotting in the Scientific Python Community, but it's
   interface is a bit outdated. mpld3 is a package that adds
   interactive graphics via d3.
2. [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html) - the new kid
   on the block for python-based interactive visualization in the
   browser. It is based on the grammar of graphics, like the R package
   [ggplot](http://ggplot2.org/).

The author of mpld3 has written some interesting blogposts on the
motivation behind the development of mpld3, and the future of python
visualiation on the web.
